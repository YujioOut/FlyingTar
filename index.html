        <p>
          These sessions are not about fixing you. They are invitations to
          discover the vastness already woven into your body, your sound, your
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each session begins with curiosity. Each one ends in possibility you
          couldn&rsquo;t have scripted.

        <h2>What Makes Taren&rsquo;s Work Different?</h2>
        <p>
          Taren doesn&rsquo;t diagnose. He doesn&rsquo;t fix. He collaborates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the EmWow field &mdash; a framework of willingness, curiosity,
          and energetic invitation &mdash; he facilitates transformation that is
          subtle, potent, and deeply embodied.

            With Taren, transformation doesn&rsquo;t require effort.<br />

          EmWow is a living, breathing field of energy that responds to your
          willingness. In every session, Taren draws from:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>CuriosityWow</strong> &ndash; The power of questions that
            create
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AllWow Run</strong> &ndash; The energetic request for all
            known energies to contribute
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>EmWow Core</strong> &ndash; A collaborative dance with
            possibility
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This isn&rsquo;t a modality. It&rsquo;s a way of relating to the world
          &mdash; and to you.
